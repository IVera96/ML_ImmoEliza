# Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting real estate prices using machine learning for the company ImmoEliza. The project focuses on creating a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to predict property prices in Belgium's real estate market based on historical data.

Key features include:

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing outliers.
- Model Development: Building and optimizing a DNN model for price prediction.
- Synthetic Data Generation: Augmenting the dataset using synthetic data to improve model performance.
- Feature Importance: Identifying the most influential features using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations).
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Using Bayesian Optimization to enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy.

This platform provides valuable insights into property price trends and can be used to forecast real estate prices accurately.
